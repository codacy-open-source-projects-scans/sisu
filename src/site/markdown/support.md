# Mailing Lists

If you have a question about using Sisu that the existing documentation nor the forum does not answer, we'd like to hear from you on the [user mailing list or developer mailing list](mailing-lists.html). The latter should be used for questions about the internal design of Sisu.

Before posting your question, please search the [mailing list archives](mailing-lists.html) in case your question has been brought up before and was already answered.

# Discussion

There is a [GitHub discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) forum related to Sisu at <https://github.com/eclipse-sisu/sisu-project/discussions>.

*There is a (now deprecated) dedicated [Sisu discussion forum @ Eclipse Community Forums](https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/f/232/) where questions can be asked as alternative to using the mailing lists. Please use GitHub Discussions instead now.*

# Issue Tracker

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open a sufficiently detailed issue over in the [project's issue management](issue-management.html). We especially appreciate reports that come with suggested patches or enough information to be recreated locally.
Consider also the information about [Contributing](https://github.com/eclipse-sisu/sisu-project/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
